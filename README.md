# Welcome to the building documentation plan for d3040.com

## About

My name is Daniel Clavijo and this is the documentation plan for my personal site. Firstly, let me walk you through the document you hopefully will read. There are two main reasons why I am creating this site; the first one is to have a way to share my projects and my portfolio, the second is to learn a lot of stuff while doing so. Actually, one of the things I am beginning with right now is Github so, as the beginner's guide dictates, I created this README file to explain a little bit about this journey I have been willing to start many years ago and finally I am starting.

As a LOTR fan would say:

> "It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out of your door. You step into the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there is no knowing where you might be swept off to."

As a whole, in this file, I will list the *WIP*, *WTB* and completed activities for making this site what it is. The aim for this is that _you_, the reader, will understand a little bit more about the way I am building my so-expected-site and maybe join me in this quest into the yet-to-know future.
